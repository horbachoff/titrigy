💡 The idea was created based on the team that I was assigned to, Tier 3 (Distribute Ops) at ☘️, since my team has to operate almost 24/7 I decided to create a tool to generate a weekly on-call schedule.
  

💬 As a user, you are expected to load the web page. By clicking the "add" button, enter employees that you want to schedule for the upcoming week, and generate the weekly schedule with the "generate schedule" button.
